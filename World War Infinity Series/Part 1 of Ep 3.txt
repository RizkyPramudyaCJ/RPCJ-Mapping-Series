Meanwhile on Comet Observatory at Delta 2-15

Rosalina (Trovidian Empire) : Three months have passed, I had checked to Trovidian Home dimension, but my friends still haven't returned yet.... Are they going war with the tainted evil?... Get seized by unknown alien?... or they have find any information about... Negaversa?

Rosalina (Trovidian Empire) : Trovidian people on Setropis are also gone too.... Pleiadean people also too.... But, on Setropis's neightboured planet called Fukarina, the Trovidian people still there.... It's seems that not all of our people transported into another dimension.
Rosalina (Trovidian Empire) : Oh poor Trovidian children. Their parents went to another dimension accidentally.... I have to be worried about these children that from another planet even stars other than Miftahul.... But, what's about Rizky Pramudya?

Rosalina (Trovidian Empire) : I'm feel lonely without him.... As he was gone so long enough, he probably get threatened by Negaversa.... Also, his past life was bad due to his mom did violence merely physically nor verbally when he was child.... It makes his growth life was hampered.
