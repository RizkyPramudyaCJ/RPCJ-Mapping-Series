(News: All of microorganism size have increased. New microbe was born.) (+100M Evo-Years)

Thirvum Pranoa (Thirvum Microbe) : It's so tasty

->>(In Abyss tidepool environments)

Narrator : In other tidepool environment, the radiations were decreased now. It led to development of life. Microorganism!

(News: Many microorganisms emerged)

Akamanol Viriensis (Akamanol Microbe) : Hmmm.... here? I'm born here?... What was I supposed to be?
Akamanol Viriensis (Akamanol Microbe) : Yeah! With another microorganisms here too.... I see that.... All of known life are at deep ocean like me.
Akamanol Viriensis (Akamanol Microbe) : Woah, these weird materials are probably for ATP making process.... Also, even much of oxygen and glucose here.

Occecum Fislosra (Occecum Microbe) : This worlds seems weird.
Occecum Fislosra (Occecum Microbe) : Ahh okay I still doubt what this kind of world supposed for?... Evolution?... I don't know.

Jopuem Prokaryote (Jopuem Bacteria) : Huh.... I'm bacteria myself? Why? So I need nuclei for become Microbe?... I will figure it out.

Zonestoem Sogulia (Zonestoem Microbe) : What is this?... Oh, this place are rich of oxygen and glucose. But, I'm sufficient right now.

(All of microorganism growth larger.) (+100M Evo-Years)
(News: Jopuem Prokaryote become microbe and namely Jopuem Sunaensis.)

Akamanol Viriensis (Akamanol Microbe) : I'm felt annoyed with these microbe.

(News: Akamanol attempt to engulf another microbes)

Mysterious Microorganism : These microbes annoys me.... I will shoot them with my "weapon" agent.

Zonestoem Sogulia (Zonestoem Microbe) : ARRRGH!!! I MUST RUN FROM HERE!!!

Jopuem Sunaensis (Jopuem Microbe) : These foreign projectiles just make me trouble.... I must escape from it. Run!

Akamanol Viriensis (Akamanol Microbe) : Ah! This is so disgusting!... My cells get damaged by these OxyToxy toxins.
Akamanol Viriensis (Akamanol Microbe) : They should learn the lessons.

(News: Akamanol Viriensis attempt to find for engulfing mysterious microorganism. Mysterious Microorganism showed as Tocusta Prokaryote.)

Akamanol Viriensis (Akamanol Microbe) : What! He's just bacteria!?... It's seems easy to be engulfing.

(News: Akamanol Viriensis attempt to engulfing Tocusta Prokaryote.)

Akamanol Viriensis (Akamanol Microbe) : I.. though.. its.. easy.. to.. engulf.
Tocusta Prokaryote and Akamanol Viriensis : NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

(Tocusta and Akamanol both were died.)
(News: Another aggresive microorganisms emerged.)

->> (In Meso tidepool environments)

(News: The mysterious and aggressive bacteria emerged)

Amjana Prokaryote (Amjana Bacteria) : What are these weak microorganism!?... These weak microorganism should be extincted.

(News: Amjana Prokaryote attempt to attack another microorganisms with his OxyToxy agent.)

Kraniem Grytoteae (Kraniem Microbe) : Bah! These annoying agent!... What the heck are they doing to me!?... They shouldn't be dumb than me!

(News: Kraniem Grytoteae attempt to engulf Amjana Prokaryote.)

Kraniem Grytoteae (Kraniem Microbe) : Bah, my colony was damaged.

Amjana Prokaryote (Amjana Bacteria) : Argh, he doing stupid method!

Kraniem Grytoteae (Kraniem Microbe) : YES!... Even if it cost damage to my colony.
Amjana Prokaryote (Amjana Bacteria) : I hope they will learn the lessons!

(Amjana went extincted but Kraniem colony get damaged because some amount of toxins were dealt to him.)
(News: Many new microorganism species emerged massively. One have new flagella like organnels called "Pilus", one have many OxyToxy.)(+100M Evo-Years)
(Many existed microorganism got bigger and wider.)

Many aggressive bacteria : Let's execute this plan.

Punacys Kinualia (Punacys Microbe) : What are these kind of attacks?... It's so strange.

Punacys Kinualia (Punacys Microbe) : WHAT!?
