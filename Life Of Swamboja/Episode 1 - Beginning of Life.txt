Narrator : On a distant planet, eons of volcanic activity and meteor impacts had led to the development of a new phenomenon in the universe. Yeah the life.
Narrator : Simple Microbes and bacteria reside in the deep of the ocean. Start to evolve and have diversified species. Life of Swamboja begins!

(News: The first species as Microbe is born on Swamboja. It's Unarian Sepeiens)

Unarian Sepeiens (Unarian Microbe) : What?... Where am I now?... Am I birth on this strange place?... I just explore to find another microbe beside me.
Unarian Sepeiens (Unarian Microbe) : Hello? Are there someone here?... No answers? I'm say once again. Hello? Everyone is here?... Oh I'm feel alone here. I'm the first microbe here right? Oh yeah!
Unarian Sepeiens (Unarian Microbe) : Yay! I'm can freely exploring and expand here!

(Unarian Sepeiens attempt to expand on microbe tidepool environment)

Unarian Sepeiens (Unarian Microbe) : Yes, I get it. There should the compounds I need. It can help our species growth.

(News: Another microbe and first bacteria have born. They are Untrustian Kana and Croxaul Prokaryote)

Untrustian Kana (Untrustian Microbe) : Oh, I'm born here right? Oh my.... Let's explore this.
Croxaul Prokaryote (Croxaul Bacteria) : Oh my, I'm just born here. I'm as first bacteria here.... Okay I will expand here.

(Croxaul Prokaryote attempt to expand)

Croxaul Prokaryote (Croxaul Bacteria) : It's enough for me. What is that? Is that a compounds?... Yes, I'm right. I want to grow with it.

(News: Unarian Sepeiens species become slightly bigger and any microbes and bacteria populations increased.

Unarian Sepeiens (Unarian Microbe) : Well my species will growth now. At least I got glucose for my species survives purposes.

(News: Another microbe and bacteria life has been appeared)

Kraniem Grytoteae (Kraniem Microbe) : What is this kind of foreign life?... This pathetic species is so small... Without wasting time, let's engulf them.

(News: Kraniem Grytoteae attempted to engulf Untrustian Kana)

Untrustian Kana (Untrustian Microbe) : Who are you!? What are you doing with us!... Can you stop it, please!
Kraniem Grytoteae (Kraniem Microbe) : I need more ATP, foreign.... This is why I need more glucose, include you.
Untrustian Kana (Untrustian Microbe) : Find another compounds around you. This place is rich, dumb. Why you still attack us!? It is OFFENCE!
Kraniem Grytoteae (Kraniem Microbe) : What should I care with compounds on here!? I'm big and it still less for me to keep my ATP.
Kraniem Grytoteae (Kraniem Microbe) : Become our part pathetic life!
Untrustian Kana (Untrustian Microbe) : Screw you!

(Kraniem Grytoteae fully engulfed Untrustian Kana)

Untrustian Kana (Untrustian Microbe) : NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

(Kraniem Grytoteae become bigger after get engulfed)

Thirvum Prokaryote (Thirvum Bacteria) : There just be something on here.... It is weird.... What is this?... the weird phosphates?... Let's check it!
Thirvum Prokaryote (Thirvum Bacteria) : It supposedly to be combined with ammonia so we can growth bigger or even get new organells.... Woah have new organells?
Thirvum Pranoa (Thirvum Microbe) : Yeah! I've done it!

(News: Thirvum Prokaryote successfully find a new organnels named nucleus and will be evolved into eukaryote cell or also called "Microbe")
